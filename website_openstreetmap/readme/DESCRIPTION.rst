This module introduces a new website snippet "OpenStretMap" to drag and drop in
your website.

It also implements a method on "res.partner" to return the OpenStreetMap link
computed from the partner address. This method is a technical feature: it
doesn't introduce any functionality by itself, but it can be used by other
modules.
